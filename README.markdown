Silverstreak WP
===============

This is a stripped down blank theme, meant to be used as a parent theme. It includes alot of functions borrowed
from the silverstreak mini framework: http://github.com/vanntastic/silverstreak. I felt that alot of the wordpress functions could be more simplified and easier to use. This theme attempts to be pragmatic and allows you to keep your code elegant. It also makes assumptions for you, so you don't have to worry about trivial things such as where your images, js, or css directories are.

Dependencies
============

- Rake (if you want to use the setup task) : http://rake.rubyforge.org/


Usage and Installation
======================

1. Cd into your wordpress theme directory
