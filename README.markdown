Silverstreak WP
===============

This is a stripped down blank theme, meant to be used as a parent theme. It includes alot of functions borrowed
from the silverstreak mini framework: http://github.com/vanntastic/silverstreak. I felt that alot of the wordpress functions could be more simplified and easier to use. This theme attempts to be pragmatic and allows you to keep your code elegant.


Dependencies
============

- Rake (if you want to use the setup task) : http://rake.rubyforge.org/
